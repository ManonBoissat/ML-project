This folder contains:
 2 directories- "For_Evaluation" and "Temp"
 1 pdf file - project report (CS433_ML_Proj_1_Lambda-3.pdf)
 1 txt file - instructions  ("readme_1.txt") 


For the purpose of evaluation "For_Evaluation" directory should be considered only. 
implementation.py contains the implementation for the six regression methods.
For Higgs-Boson pridictor, the best performing regression model is implemented here (in run.py) to generate the prediction .csv file.
Do read "readme_2" for the instructions to setup run.py and other instructions.

"temp" is just for evaluators reference.
In the "temp" all the implementations of the experiments that were conducted to reach to the "best model" are present. 
"temp/project1.ipynb" is a notebook showing all the experiments and data visualization.
The remaining python scripts are helper functions used in "project1.ipynb".
