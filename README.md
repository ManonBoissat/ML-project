# CS-433 ML Project-1
## Classification via regression techniques: A study
For project-1 of the machine learning course,  we  implemented  six  regression
based  techniques  to  predict whether an event is for a Higgs-Boson or something else,
given a vector  of  features  representing  the  decay  signature  of  a  collision event.
We  trained  all  models  using  the  train-set  data  (labels  provided) and then evaluated the performance of each of the six models,
the  best  performing  model  and  its  corresponding  parameters were chosen for predicting the labels for the test-set data (labels unknown). 
We achieved a categorical accuracy of 79.4% in the aicrowd platform.
